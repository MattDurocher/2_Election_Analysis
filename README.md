# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project saw us helping the Colorado Board of Elections with grabbing all the data from their recent election to determine who the winner was. 
In this project, we were able to:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved
4. Calculated the percentage of votes each candicate won
5. Determined the winner of the elction based on the popular votes

All of the information was coded in a .py file with instructions to export the important information requested by the Colorado Board of Elections into and easy to read .txt file.

## Resources
To complete this, the data file election_results.csv was used to pull election data from while the code do determine the outcome was written in Python using Visual Studio Code.

- There were 369,711 votes caast in the election

## Overview of Election Audit
This Election Audit Analysis was done in order to find out the results of a local elction looking for data on the amount of votes cast in total/for each candidate to determine a winner. Then, votes were analyzed by county so see which county had the largest turnout of of the three. Votes per candidate and county were measured in both amount and percentage of the total. Here are the printed results:

## Election_Audit Results

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
## Election-Audit Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
