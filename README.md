# Election_Analysis

## Module Overview
This project saw us helping the Colorado Board of Elections with grabbing all the data from their recent election to determine who the winner was. 
In this project, we were able to:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determined the winner of the election based on the popular votes

All of the information was coded in a .py file with instructions to export the important information requested by the Colorado Board of Elections into an easy to read .txt file.

## Module Resources
To complete this, the data file election_results.csv was used to pull election data from while the code to determine the outcome was written in Python using Visual Studio Code.

## Module Summary
The project code shows the following:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- There were three candidates (listed below):
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- Their results showed that:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes (85,213 total votes).
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes (272,892 total votes).
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes (11,606 total votes).
- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the votes (272,892 total votes).

## Overview of Election Audit
This Election Audit Analysis was done in order to find out the results of a local election looking for data on the amount of votes cast in total/for each candidate to determine a winner. Then, votes were analyzed by county so see which county had the largest turnout of the three. Votes per candidate and county were measured in both amount and percentage of the total. Here are the printed results:

## Election-Audit Summary
One example on how to modify the code for another election would be to track more data and output those findings. We tracked two things, candidate and county. We could track tax brackets, city, household size, etc. in order to get more information about the voters to better analyze or predict voting patterns. Another modification would then be to be able to take these new categories and put them up against the total results as a whole. Find out what percentage of voters in a given tax bracket voted for each candidate or find out which percentage of voters in a given county or the election as a whole were in a specific tax bracket. No matter what modification is made for the next election, a deeper understanding of the populus would be achieved as long as the government expands the data that they want to track. Once this happens, they will be able to understand voters better and better with the addition of each category.
