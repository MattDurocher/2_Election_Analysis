# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved

5. Determined the winner of the elction based on the popular votes

All of the information was coded in a .py file with instructions to export the important information requested by the Colorado Board of Elections into and easy to read .txt file.

## Overview of Election Audit
This Election Audit Analysis was done in order to find out the results of a local elction looking for data on the amount of votes cast in total/for each candidate to determine a winner. Then, votes were analyzed by county so see which county had the largest turnout of of the three. Votes per candidate and county were measured in both amount and percentage of the total. Here are the printed results:
